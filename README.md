# Wordle Solver
This repository contains the source code for [our team](#team)'s project for univeristy. Our assignment was to implement an algorithm that would play Wordle as optimally as it could (win with least attempts statistically), based on information theory.

## What is Wordle? 

Wordle is a popular [online word guessing game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). To win, you should guess the 5-letter-word in maximum six tries. After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word as it follows: 
- green means the letter is in the word and in the correct spot
- yellow means the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot
- grey means the letter is not in the word in any spot

There aren't any clues up front, so any five-letter word will do as an initial guess, if played by a human. 

## How does Wordle-Solver work?
There's a list of words that are considered valid guesses (`cuvinte_wordle.txt`) which both the `base.py` (picks a random word to be guessed) and `solver.py` (chooses the next optimal guess) can access.

The solver calculates the entropies for all words, using all possible variations of tiles of an input, in each round. It returns the word which has the highest entropy from the list of the remaining candidates. The list receives the feedback of the last guess from the game and is filtered after each guess.

When you make **a guess**, there’s 243 possible results of tiles (the three outcomes -grey, yellow, green- to the power 5 because it’s possible independently for each letter). Each pattern filters the list accordingly, based on the match between this possible pattern and the answer. So each pattern filters the list more or less, therefore we can calculate the probability to guess the answer from that filtered list, if we expect that specific pattern. We calculate this probability of all 243 patterns for each word and by using Shannon's entropy we find the entropy of every word in the list.

## Implementing the solution
So the algorithm does two things repeatedly:

- Picks the word with the best-entropy from the word list
- Filters the word list to only include words that fit the result we just got

> Assuming all target words share the same chance, we do not use word frequency to reweight them.

## Short description of files
`cuvinte_wordle.txt` is the list of 11454 words considered valid guesses\
`entropies.txt` contains the sorted entropies in descending order of each word for the first guess; generated by `entropy_calculator.py` - uses **multithreading**\
`coduri.txt` contains all 243 possible patterns that a guess could return; is generated by `generare_coduri.py`\
`solutii.txt` contains all the guesses for each word generated by `solutions.py`\
`functions.py` contains some helper functions 

## Conclusions
The optimal first guess is **TAREI** and the **average number of attempts to a solution is 4.374192421861358.**
